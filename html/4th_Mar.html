	<h1 style="text-align:center">FusionCharts-As a workplace & its Product</h1>
	<p>FusionCharts kolkata,Which is our destination for today. Our office has a very informal enviornment,
	there is no dress code in our office,so no need to be worried about the cloths weather it's formal or not.
	<q><strong>The best part is that the company belives in the talent of a person, not in their degree or cloths.
	</strong></q>
	After entering in the office we get few gifts which made us happy as we all like gifts. There is no any comlicated format of working. Just do your work Properly and enjoy Lots of pizzas' party.The ambience of the office is “wow”,“amazing”.But As we know that walls and furniture just create the ambience but the actual and the real works are done by the employees. After going through the book which is provided by Smitanjana ma’am,I came to know about the company’s beginning and the  growth of the company from  jan 2002 till today. So this growth proves that it’s a good workplace and employees  who are working here really like the work and the workplace too.Thats is why it has 500,000 developers ,across 120 countries.</p>
	<p>Today we met the people who are working here ,I mean my seniors. The experience was really good. Through the introduction process we came to know about different teams who are working on different different products, and the people who are going to guide us.. As well as we talk to Swarnam ma’am and the technical support team of Bangalore. All the seniors are humble and nice.. when I was coming for the office I was nervous but after all the introduction and video call, feeling very light,and I will must say that  FusionCharts’ workplace is employee friendly,I am not the only person who is saying this, the no. of employees is saying everything about the success and the no. of customers are saying about the quality of the products of FusionCharts. So now about the Products of FusionCharts.The products are, 
	<mark>FusionCharts XT , FusionWidgets XT , PowerCharts XT , FusionMaps XT</mark>.
	Till now I have used FusionChartsXT as it supports all the platform i.e.  no specific requirement is needed for using that, is the best part I like about the products. It gives delightful charts of different different types,and easy to understand. Exporting the created chart facilities in different different format is also there.
	</p>
	<p>It is obvious that all the products are good that’s why it has  24,000 customers
	and the most exciting part is that even Barack Obama is using the FusionCharts and the company is in profit.
	As it is my first day so that’s all from my side.
	Thank you, for reading .. :)
